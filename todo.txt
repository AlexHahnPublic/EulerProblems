This is a list of things I'd like to still do while working through these Euler
Problems^^

Remaining ToDo's:
  1) Finish the correct, mathematical solution for problem 4 (Newton polynomial? divided differnce?)
  2) Investigate better timing methods/ conventions
  3) Combine popular/ common functions into modules to import
  4) Write a test harness/ script that runs all of these? outputs a log file?
  5) After completing 25 problems go back and review/ tighten up code/ comments
  6) Code up the list comprehensions method for problem 8 (see thread), could learn a bit


Solved ToDo's:
  1) PROBLEM:
        Problem 3 can be worked on/ there is a major todo in there/ it doesn't work
        for certain numbers (numbers where the multiplicity of the largest prime factor is greater than 1.
     SOLUTION:
        added condition that terminates division loop when divisor is the number itself.
  2) Added timing code to all programs. Still should investigate more timing conventions
