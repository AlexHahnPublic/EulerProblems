This is a list of things I'd like to still do while working through these Euler
Problems^^

Remaining ToDo's:
  1) Add the timing code to all of the programs
  2) Finish the correct, mathematical solution for problem 4
  3) Investigate better timing methods
  4) combine popular/ common functions into modules to import
  5) write a test harness/ script that runs all of these? outputs a log file?


Solved ToDo's:
  1) PROBLEM:
        Problem 3 can be worked on/ there is a major todo in there/ it doesn't work
        for certain numbers (numbers where the multiplicity of the largest prime factor is greater than 1.
     SOLUTION:
        added condition that terminates division loop when divisor is the number itself.
