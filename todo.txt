This is a list of things I'd like to still do while working through these Euler
Problems^^

1) Add the timing code to all of the programs
2) Investigate better timing methods
3) combine popular/ common functions into modules to import
4) write a test harness/ script that runs all of these? outputs a log file?
5) Problem 3 can be worked on/ there is a major todo in there/ it doesn't work
for certain numbers
