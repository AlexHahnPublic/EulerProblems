# Euler Problem 53:
# There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:
#   123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 245, 345
# In combinatorics, we use the notation 5C3 = 10
# In general,
#   nCr = (n!)/(r!(n-r)!), where r <= n, n! = n x (n-1) n ... x 2 x 1, and 0!=1
#   by convention
# It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23 C 10 = 114406.
#
# How many, not necessarily distinct, values, of nCr, for 1
