# Euler Problem 29: # Consider all integer combinations of a^b for 2<=a<=5 and 2<=b<=5:
#
#       2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32
#       3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243
#       4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024
#       5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125
#
# If they are placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the
# following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
#       4,8,9,16,25,27,32,64,81,125,243,256,625,1024,3125
#
# How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by a^b for 2<=a<=100
# and 2<=b<=100?

# Solution
# -----------------------------------------------

# So it turns out to be a little more complex than this below algo, but
# I'll leave it up as a good start/ baseline for the mathy solution

# Let's write out the 2<=x,y<=10 case seeing if we can pick up the pattern as
# we go (also see if there's a function that generates the number of distinct
# terms with increasing n (unlikely I think)):

# Now you may point out that we only went one direction here, only reducing the
# exponent down when possible and not ever factoring down the base. This is
# reasonable to do because once we find all the equivalences from the smallest
# base there's no reason to recalc them at higher bases.

# So now we observe that any exponents that are have divisors can all be
# refactored to a new base and a divided exponent until it's prime. A decent
# strategy is to create a set of two-tuples then weave through the entries,
# eliminating all the equivalent entries in place

# So it turns out that we didn't cover all the repetitions with this below
# strategy, for example this above method fails to point out that 4^6 is
# equivalent to 8^4. This is because we only rewrite the exponent from the
# current base upwards, ie 8^4=(8x8)x(8x8)=64^2, in our n=10 case the base is
# >10 so we don't include however 4^6=8^4, however in our code we only
# check that 2 and 3 is a divisor of the exponent in 4^6 and therefore
# calculate that 4^6=16^3=64^2, since both bases are above 10, we don't
# include, however if we break 4^6 down into 2^12 first then we can run our
# divisors method and see that 8^4 does infacy get hit by 4^6. Originally we
# didn't hit this in base 2 because 12 was bigger than our n. We can
# rework our algo to run this kind of break down of the base then take all
# combinations of the smallest base.
