# Euler Problem 4:
# A palindrome number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009= 91 x 99.
# Find the largest palindrome madefrom the product of two 3 digit numbers

# This problem is easy to brute force, we're more mature than that. My general
# approach is two start at 999*999 and while isPalindrome is false compute
# the next largest number. This is slightly harder than it sounds because
# coming up with a function/ iteration that gives the next largest number
# from the product of two numbers isn't exactly straightforward
